-- Fix infinite recursion in user_profiles RLS policy
-- This migration fixes the recursive policy issue that prevents data insertion

-- Drop the problematic policy that causes infinite recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all profiles" ON public.user_profiles;

-- Create a simpler policy that doesn't cause recursion
-- Allow users to insert their own profile and service_role to manage all
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.user_profiles
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow service_role to manage all profiles (for admin operations)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all profiles" ON public.user_profiles
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Temporarily disable RLS on beneficiaries to allow test data insertion
-- We'll re-enable it after inserting test data
