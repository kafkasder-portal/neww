# ðŸ”§ Authentication Debug Summary

## Issues Fixed

### âœ… Root Cause Identified
- **Configuration Error**: Supabase credentials were set to placeholder values
- **Network Errors**: Authentication requests were failing due to invalid Supabase URL/keys

### âœ… Solutions Implemented

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added `AuthErrorBoundary` component to catch configuration errors
   - Improved environment validation with clearer error messages
   - Added technical details and solution guidance

2. **Mock Authentication System**:
   - Created fallback authentication for development (`src/lib/mockAuth.ts`)
   - Automatically detects when Supabase is not configured
   - Provides demo credentials: `demo@example.com` / `demo`

3. **User-Friendly Setup**:
   - Added development notice on login page
   - Created `SETUP.md` with step-by-step configuration guide
   - Added "Connect to Supabase" button for easy setup

4. **Automatic Detection**:
   - App automatically switches to mock mode when Supabase is misconfigured
   - No more network errors during development

## Current Status

âœ… **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:5173  
âœ… **API Server**: Running on http://localhost:3002  
âœ… **Authentication**: Working in mock mode  
âœ… **Error Handling**: Improved with user guidance  

## Next Steps for Production

To use real authentication, you need to:

1. **[Connect to Supabase](#open-mcp-popover)** (Recommended)
   - Automatically sets up Supabase project
   - Configures environment variables

2. **Manual Setup**:
   - Create Supabase project at https://supabase.com
   - Update `.env` with your credentials:
     ```env
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
     ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

## Demo Credentials (Mock Mode)

- **Email**: `demo@example.com`
- **Password**: `demo`

The app will automatically detect when you have proper Supabase credentials and switch to real authentication.
